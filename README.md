# Self Balancing Bot
A bot with two wheels similar to a unicycle that could balance itself on its own using arduino.

Items used:
1) Arduino UNO
2) MPU6050
3) Motor Driver
4) High torque motors
5) Cardboard to build the structure

The balancing of the bot involves just simple physics. Whenever the bot tilts in one direction a torque is applied by the motors in opposte direction to balance the bot.
